<!--inline is best suited when we're only trying to style 1 element
<html style="background:blue">
</html>
style = attribute name
"background:blue" = attribute value
in this case the style attribute is globally availbe which is used to style the entire html element.
this style is not reccomened since we will need to add the in line style to every element we want to style.
